created a tip calculator
we learnt about datatypes and some of their methods
subscripting
type conversion
conditionals, f-strings
and typechecking
short hand operations

you can represent a large number like this 12345678 as 123_456_678 and '//' floor division- to divide cleanly
The tip calculator gets the total amount and splits it divides it by the total no of people
gives a percentage of the total amount as tip returns the divided splitted bill
