We build our capstone project
BLACKJACK
We are given a deck of cards
we draw 2 carfd from the deck
we create a function that calculates the sum of our cards
we check if the 2 cards we have is a blackjack i.e 10 and 11 
if we  convert  the 11 to a 1
we check if we have a black-jack or the user score is over 21
we  check if another card is to be dealt
the computer can only draw if it doesnt have a blackjack  and its less than 17
we compare scores between user and computer
