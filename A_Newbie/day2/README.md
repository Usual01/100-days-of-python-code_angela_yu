we Created a tip calculator
We learnt about datatypes and some of their methods
Subscripting
Type conversion
Conditionals, F-strings
and Typechecking
Short hand operations

Sou can represent a large number like this 12345678 as 123_456_678 and '//' floor division- to divide cleanly
The tip calculator gets the total amount and splits it divides it by the total no of people
and gives a percentage of the total amount as tip returns the divided splitted bill
